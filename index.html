                "Today, I met with my Chairman of the Department of Linguistics, a passionate and dedicated professor. I am deeply inspired by him as he is an influential person with extensive experience in linguistics, spanning from India to the University of Massachusetts in America. As one of his students, I am currently working on a state government project involving Artificial Intelligence."
